          <h3>Create the look you envision with fabric backdrops.</h3>
                 <p>Backdrops can be
used to create a focal point behind a head table, ceiling, outdoor patio, or
transform a blank space. By using drapery tiebacks and fabric swags, you
can provide an added touch to your space.</p>

<p>You can also create a fresh look and feel to your event with canopies,
cabanas, columns, and chuppahs. Whether you want your DJ to be
enclosed in a cabana, have a lounge area for your guests, or want to
enhance the overall look of your venue, Concept Effects can help.</p>

<p>By combining your fabric design with lighting, you can enhance the overall
atmosphere of the room and completely transform the space.</p>

<p>Dance under the stars with a white dance floor or LED Dance floor.</p>

<p>Turn your lounge area in to a VIP atmosphere with white leather lounge
furniture and our custom LED furniture. Pricing available upon request for
our exclusive line of LED and Lounge Furniture</p>
